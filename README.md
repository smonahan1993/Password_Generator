# Password_Generator
HW 3 for coding bootcamp

In this exercise, we were instructed to add javascript to existing html/css code which generated a random password. 

The password asks the user how many characters they'd like for it to be between 8 and 128, as well as whether to include upper/lower case letters, numeric values, and special characters.
